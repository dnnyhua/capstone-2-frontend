## Problem We are Solving
- The problem that this app is solving is finding someone to walk your dog when you are not able to.
- This application allows the user to sign up as a dog owner to find someone to walk their dog OR the user can sign up as a dog walker to walk someone's dog.

## As a Dog Owner
- The user can add dogs to their account, and each pet will have a profile that a dog walker can view upon hiring.
- The user can post a job that will have the date of when the walk will take place, time of walk, duration, indicate which dog can go on this walk, address, city, state, and zipcode (Full address will only be displayed to walkers that are hired).
- Applications will come in for the jobs posted and the user can decide who to hire.
- The scheduled walk will be added to the dashboard and on each pet's profile you can see their schedule.

## As a Dog Walker
- The user can look for jobs posted by dog owners.
- The user can set their own rate per 30 min walk.
- The job search bar uses city, state, and zipcode and will return results matching any of the 3. For example, if there are jobs in a specific zipcode, it will return jobs within the city and if there are no jobs in that city it will return jobs within that state.
- Once the user applies to a job it will be posted on the dashboard and will show which job they were hired for and which is still going under review.







# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
